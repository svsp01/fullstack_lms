        HTML tags are like keywords which define how a web browser will format
        and display the content. With the help of tags, a web browser can
        distinguish between HTML content and simple content. HTML tags contain
        three main parts: opening tag, content, and closing tag. However, some
        HTML tags are unclosed tags.
      </p>
      <p>
        An HTML file must have some essential tags so that the web browser can
        differentiate between simple text and HTML text. You can use as many
        tags as you want as per your code requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a web browser reads an HTML document, it reads it from top to
        bottom and left to right. HTML tags are used to create HTML documents
        and define their properties. Each HTML tag has different properties.

        All HTML tags must be enclosed within &lt; &gt; these brackets. Every
        tag in HTML performs different tasks. If you have used an opening tag
        &lt;tag&gt;, then you must use a closing tag &lt;/tag&gt; (except for
        some tags).
