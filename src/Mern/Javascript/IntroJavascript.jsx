          JavaScript is not a compiled language, but it is a translated
          language. The JavaScript Translator (embedded in the browser) is
          responsible for translating the JavaScript code for the web browser.

        <h3>What is JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
          JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language
          which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an
          interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic
          interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. It was
          introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the
          Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted by all
          other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern
          web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every
          time. The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of
          interactivity and simplicity.
